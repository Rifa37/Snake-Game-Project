# Snake-Game-Project
About the Project:
The project implements a game called Snake Game. The main motive of my project is to guide a snake to consume as much food as possible without colliding with its body or hitting the wall. I have make the snake green and the food red. When the snake consumes food it grow longer. 

Instruction on how to run my project:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the folder where "App.java" file is located, then press Run java.
2. The snake can be controlled using the Left, Right, Up, and Down arrow keys.
3. If the snake collides with food, the score increases. However, if the snake collides with itself, the game is over.
4. When the game is over their will be a text that “Press any key to restart” so by pressing any key the game will restart.
